KOZM has risen to the scene as one of the most formidable and unique music duos, described by LA Weekly as “avant-sonic acrobats” and “the most rock ’n’ roll pair of classically trained musicians working today” by 21st Century Musician. Often compared to both Reinhardt and Grappelli  for their virtuosic intensity, the music of KOZM is multi-textured, profound and riveting. While their compositions have been described as “elegant, delicate, cross-genre amalgamations” by the Michigan Daily, what’s made the group so unique is the colossal sound they generate from just a violin and a guitar. What began in early 2011 with a casual jam session in Los Angeles, soon evolved when Othe duo began to compose their own original music. Over the last few years, they have performed over 200 concerts in 18 states and the group released their first full-length album ‘hello Kaleidoscope’ in 2013 under their former name ‘Duo del Sol’ which was nomitated  for an Independent Music Award that year.

The release takes the listener through various stages of the sleep cycle, with interludes sprinkled throughout; “Stage I: Light Sleep”,  “Stage III: Deep Sleep”, “Stage V: REM”. The EP was co-produced by Grammy winner Andre de Santanna (Ziggy Marley, Jason Mraz, Sergio Mendes) and De’Anza herself. In addition to singing she also performs vihuela, guitar, piano and programs drums.\n\n\n“I first read the words ‘Cosmic Dream’ by an eastern mystic I follow and felt incredibly drawn to it,” says De’Anza of the EP’s title. “The opening of the album introduces the notion of what we understand as life/reality and correlating it to watching a movie.”\n \n\n\nBorn and raised in Santa Fe, New Mexico, an epicenter of convergent cultures and rich folk art, De’Anza journeyed west to Los Angeles armed with a vihuela, a passion for songwriting, and a mission to develop her own musical identity. Cosmic Dream has the songwriter fully embracing her love for electronic music and implementing those sonic influences into her evolving production style. \n\n\nDe’Anza’s emergence in the industry was quickly met with critical praise. The 2015 release of her debut, Despertar, catapulted her from obscure indie to “Latin Alternative’s New Leading Lady” as proclaimed by the OC Weekly.\n\n\nWith features from CNN, to ABC’s Vista L.A., to popular radio outlets like NPR, De’Anza has been turning heads converting fans nationally and internationally. Felix Contreras of NPR Music’s Alt.Latino describes her music as, “powerful writing and a clever mixture of contemporary and traditional Mexican music” and LA Weekly writes, “De’Anza herself is a force of nature behind the microphone.”","modified":"2018-05-31 12:51:50","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"De'Anza Live Performance & Signing - All Ages!","venue_address":"6400 W.
